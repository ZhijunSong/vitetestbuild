    <p style="font-size:12px; text-align:left">&nbsp&nbsp With the rise of information technology and transportation powers, more unrevealed information, such as wifi signals and a minuscule level of sound of the city, is contained in the air, existing as the signs and noises in our environment that residents of the town ignore. However, with the ubiquitous practices of the city, walking, shopping, or even just passing by, browsing the street view, have become intensely engaged in city life. Walking out through thousands of different paths that are occasionally crossed, merged, intertwined, and then diverged, these trials are creating the entire movable networks, the true vision of our city from a more private and personal angle from each individual, of the fragmented truth.
This thesis project is creating an entertaining AR experience to clarify the density of the networks on which we depend, visualizing the ignored information carried by the noise in the city. It aims to reveal the invisible systems (webs in which we are caught). As people don't like to be aware of these systems on which we depend, this project is creating a complete experience of all the stimuli, systems, and networks that exist outdoors in New York City and making Certeau's rambler aware of all the manmade networks in which we live. By applying those 'colorful portals,' what we call 'A-tag,' a tiny maintenance hole that covers the ground, as the marker to display the AR visuals, this project will bring each person to see a different world full of infographics through their phone:
It will lift the hood of the car to view the engine and tell the massive and collective narratives of the city machine .</p>
